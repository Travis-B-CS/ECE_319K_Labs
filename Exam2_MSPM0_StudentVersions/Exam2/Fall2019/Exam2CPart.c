Check the medicine record for one day to make sure grandmother

Inputs: aDay, one record of one day's medicine (populated with pill data)
Output: 
  return 8 if each PillCount[i] matches each RxCount[i] for all i from 0 to NumPills-1
  return i if a PillCount[i] is less than RxCount[i] for some i from 0 to NumPills-1

Error conditions: 
  there are no test cases where some counts are lower than expected AND at least one count is higher than expected
  return 8 if NumOfPills is 0 (grandmother needs no pills).
